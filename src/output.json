How? Keep pushing projects at Twitter that have been working on developing a decentralized social network protocol (e.g., BlueSky). It's not easy, but the backend must run on decentralized infrastructure, APIs should become open (back to the roots! Twitter started and became big with open APIs). Twitter would be one of many clients to post and consume content. Then create a marketplace for algorithms, e.g., if you're a snowflake and don't want content that offends you pick another algorithm. 2.) \"Solve Share Price\" Current state of the business: Twitter's ad revenues grow steadily and for the time being, are sufficient to fund operations.
